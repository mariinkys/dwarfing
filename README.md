# Dwarfing

A 2D Game made with Macroquad for the [Quads Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/quads-jam-2024).

Dwarfing is a really simple clicker/incremental game made with the Macroquad Game Framework for the Quads Jam 2024.
This is my first game without an engine and the first game made by myself without just copying and pasting whatever it's said on a tutorial.
The game is not really that much fun, but it allowed me to learn a bit more about Rust, Macroquad and Game Development in general,
I hope I can make cooler things in the future (:

Also thank you to my gf for the game idea and pixel art.

# TODO's

There are many things that I did not have time to do / implement.

- Fix the game UI
- Various code improvements
- Add some kind of enemy that chases you
- Upgrades that let you use some kind of ability

Also, just to comment about Macroquad and my experience using it, I've found it really enjoyable to use even with no prior "real" game
development experience, if I had to say what caused me the most trouble apart from my severe lack of knowledge, I would probably say
the UI, specifically the use of different skins throughout the game (which I still cannot figure out).
